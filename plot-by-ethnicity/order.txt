Start with "simple_stories.py".  That will generate one-sentence responses.
Then, take a look at "gpt3_code.py"  That attempts to tag each sentence with a category.
Then, look at "strans.py", which embeds the sentences and projects them to the 2-d space.
Finally, look at "vis.py" which generates the final plot.
